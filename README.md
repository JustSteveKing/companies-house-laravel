A Laravel wrapper to get Companies House information and validate company numbers. This is a work in progress and more methods will be added to the API as they are required.

This has been tested thoroughly in Laravel 8. Laravel 7 is supported, but if you find issues please do drop a detailed issue.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require juststeveking/companies-house-laravel
```

You can publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JustSteveKing\CompaniesHouseLaravel\CompaniesHouseLaravelServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'api' => [
        'key' => env('COMPANIES_HOUSE_KEY', ''),
        'url' => env('COMPANIES_HOUSE_URL', 'https://api.companieshouse.gov.uk')
    ]
];
```

## Usage

Using it inline:

```php
use JustSteveKing\CompaniesHouseLaravel\Client;

// Make a new client
$api = Client::make();

// Get Company information from a company number
$company = $api->company('company-number');
```

Using the validation inline:

```php
$this->validate($request, [
    'company_number' => [
        'required',
        'string',
        Rule::companyNumber()
    ]
]);
```

Searching for a company by name. Please note: this will return an empty collection if there are no results:

```php
use JustSteveKing\CompaniesHouseLaravel\Client;

$api = Client::make();

// Get a collection of Company\SearchResult inside of a CompanyCollection
$results = $api->searchCompany('Name you want to search');

// You now have access to all standard Laravel collection methods
$results->each(function ($result) {
    // Do something with the result here.
});
```

Fetching a collection of company officers will return an `OfficerCollection`:

```php
use JustSteveKing\CompaniesHouseLaravel\Client;

$api = Client::make();

// Get a collection of Company\SearchResult inside of a CompanyCollection
$results = $api->getOfficers('company-number');

// You now have access to all standard Laravel collection methods
$results->each(function ($result) {
    // Do something with the result here.
});
```


## Testing

### Using this library in your own tests

There is a relatively simple testing utility on this library that allows you to fake the underlying HTTP client:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http
use JustSteveKing\CompaniesHouseLaravel\Client;

$fakedApi = Client::fake([
    'https://api.companieshouse.gov.uk/*',
    Http::response([], 200, [])
]);
```

To understand how to use this part, please follow the Laravel documentation for [Testing the Http Client](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/http-client#testing)



Run the unit tests:

``` bash
composer test
```
